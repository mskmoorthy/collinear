## Write a program to test collinearity of three points in a plane (2d)



 - Inspired by Brain Hayes article Writing Programs for "The Book" - Chapter 33 Beautiful COde https://github.com/onestraw/ebook/blob/master/09_other/%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E4%B9%8B%E7%BE%8EBeautiful%20Code.pdf page 539

-  Three different algorithms to Test Collinearity of three points

- You can extend the third method to find whether four points in 3d  are co-planar - But I was advised not to give that example as it might take away from unit tests

-  Please look at the unit tests. See whether you can add more unit tests
